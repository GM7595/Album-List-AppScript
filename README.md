This is an AppScript to keep track of your Google Drive album collection in Google SpreadSheet. 
The main list shows your artists, and the script dedicates a sheet for each artist containing their albums. 

How to use:
1. Make sure your google drive folder is in (main folder/artist folders/album folders) format. 
2. Make a new Spreadsheet on Google Sheets, and paste the contents of the script.js into the Project Editor.
3. Inside the script, edit the parent variable (where it says "ENTER ID HERE") and put the Google Drive folder ID of your main folder (The random text in the folder's link after "https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/").
4. Now press "Run" to run the code, and after some time the Spreadsheet should display the contents.
